# Math

The purpose of this repository is to provide some python3 libraries to do advanced applied mathematics.

It will start simple with linear algebra and calculus, and will grow over time to include more advanced mathematics.

Please reach out before using any files/scripts/code from this repository in and proprietary or monetized projects, completely free projects may use anything they want to without permissions so long as they are not making money off of it.

So to sum up, use it as much as you want but if you want to charge for it then reach out to me first and ask permission.

This is intended to be a library/package more than a standalone anything, inputs and outputs do not have an interface beyond the python3 console.
