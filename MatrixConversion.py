#The purpose of this python library will be to compute linear equations into a matrix
#It will take in n equations with n variables and will convert them to a matrix as long as they have the same elements
#It can also turn linear equations into their standard form through algebraic operations
#It will take in equations as strings, and output arrays/matrices
