#The purpose of this file will be to take in multiple equations in string format
#in order to convert them into matrix form. The functionality is as follows:
#
#Takes in multiple strings, for example "2x + 3y + 4z = 1", "3x + 2y + z 5"
#It formats them into proper matrix form
#It will pass back the following list of lists (matrix)
#
#[[2, 3, 4, 1], [3, 2, 1, 5]]
#
#This is general purpose in order to convert n equations into a matrix
#of n size.
#
#This does not turn the equations into standard format, it simply formats the matrix
#
